2 . Copy the following content into the `.env` file:

```bash
# Database connection string (DSN)
# Example: "username:password@tcp(hostname:port)/database_name?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true"
DB_URL=""

# Port on which the backend application will run
# Example: "4040"
PORT="4040"

# Random character string for JWT token encryption
# Example: "audgiawudadaidiawyf123"
SECRET="audgiawudadaidiawyf123"

```

Remember to replace all example values with your actual credentials and configuration details.

### Run appllication

After setting up all the environment variables, run the application by typing:

```bash
  go run main.go
```

## API Documentation

This system uses Swagger to generate comprehensive API documentation. There are two ways to access the documentation:

### Method 1: Using Local Server

1 . Set up the environment:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - At minimum, add the following environment variable:
     ```bash
     DB_URL="username:password@tcp(hostname:port)/database_name?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=true"
     ```
   - Replace `DB_URL` with your actual database connection string.

2 . Run the application:
```bash
  go run main.go
```

3 . Access the Swagger documentation:
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:4040/swagger/

This will allow you to view and interact with the API documentation without needing to configure AWS, GCP, or Brevo environment settings. However, some features that depend on AWS, GCP, or Brevo services may not be fully functional when running with this minimal configuration.

### Method 2: Using Swagger Editor

1 . Go to the docs folder in the application files.

2 . Choose either the swagger.json or swagger.yaml file.

3 . Copy the contents of the chosen file.

4 . Paste the contents into the left side of the Swagger Editor at https://editor-next.swagger.io/

5 . You can view the generated API documentation on the right side of the screen.
